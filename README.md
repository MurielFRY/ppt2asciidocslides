# PPT to Asciidoc converter

Asciidoc is a great tool for publishing technical information. Some time ago I changed my presentation slides from PowerPoint to Asciidoc. Because I had so many PPT slides I wrote this converter to get a first draft.

The converter is a command line tool written in Java. It uses Maven as a build tool and `org.apache.poi:poi-ooxmlÂ´ to access the raw PPTX files.

In the _distribution_ folder is a batch file and a Jar. Either call:

    $ java -jar pptx2adoc.jar Slide.pptx

or

    $ convert Slide.pptx


Supported options:

| Option      | Description  | Default  |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| output      | Specifies the target filename | Input filename and suffix _.adoc_ |
| writeImages | If images get extracted and written or not | true |
| imageFolder | Folder for the generated images |  _Images_ |
